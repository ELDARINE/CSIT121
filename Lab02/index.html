    <h1>Sel Roti</h1>
    <h2>A Traditional Nepali Delight</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups rice flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup ripe bananas, mashed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>Pinch of turmeric powder (optional, for color)</li>
        <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>Sugar, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine rice flour, all-purpose flour, mashed bananas, yogurt, cardamom powder, cumin seeds, and baking powder. Mix well to form a thick batter. If desired, add a pinch of turmeric powder for a golden color.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Make sure it's hot but not smoking.</li>
        <li>Take a funnel-shaped plastic or metal funnel (Sel Roti mold) and dip it into the hot oil for a minute to heat it.</li>
        <li>Pour a ladleful of the batter into the funnel while blocking the bottom hole with your finger. Slowly release your finger to allow the batter to flow into the hot oil in a circular motion, creating a ring shape. Be careful not to overcrowd the pan; you may need to fry them in batches.</li>
        <li>Fry the Sel Roti until they turn golden brown on both sides, turning them occasionally with a spatula. It should take about 4-5 minutes per Sel Roti.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried Sel Roti and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with a sprinkle of sugar on top. Sel Roti is best enjoyed with tea or yogurt.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Sel Roti holds a special place in my heart because it's not just a delicious traditional Nepali snack but also a symbol of celebration and togetherness. Whether it's a festive occasion or a simple family gathering, Sel Roti is always a delightful treat that brings joy to everyone.</p>
