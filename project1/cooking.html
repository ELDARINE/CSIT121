      <h2>When did it started</h2>
      <p>what makes cooking fun varies from person to person. It's a versatile and rewarding activity that can provide a sense of joy and satisfaction, whether you're a novice or an experienced chef. For me i started to cook about few years back. my mom and dad were always out for work in high school alone in home i was too lasy to make anything. we had all the ingridents in the home, i ate sandwitchs for few 7 weeks i got boared so i started to cook food that i was familier with. after i was condifent in it i tried indian, chineese, french and italian though most of them were not up to my expection. this is one the recipe of one of my first food.</p>

            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For the Filling:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>200g ground meat (chicken, pork, or beef)</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cabbage, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup green onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough by mixing flour, water, and a pinch of salt. Knead until the dough is smooth and elastic. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the dough is resting, prepare the filling. Combine ground meat, chopped onion, garlic, ginger, cabbage, green onions, ground cumin, ground coriander, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough into thin circles, about 4 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each dough circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Pinch the edges to seal the momo.</li>
        <li>Steam the momos in a steamer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the dough is cooked and the filling is tender.</li>
        <li>Serve momos hot with a dipping sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, and chili paste.</li>
    </ol>
      <P>I am going to be real here, this is completely different from Chinese dumplings I would ask you to try the Momo made by professional that way you have real expectation about the outcome. After few tries you can tweak it to your liking.  </P>
